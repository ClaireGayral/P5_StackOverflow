    \begin{itemize}
        \item Une analyse sur 3 échelles
        \item Deux façons de modéliser le problème
        \item Meilleur modèle = interprétabilité + facilité de calculs
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{0.2cm} 
    Améliorations et suite :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finir de faire un script avec le meilleur modèle en PEP8
        \item Utiliser la table "orders" pour caractériser les clusters de clients
